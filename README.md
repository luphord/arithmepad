# DEPRECATED
This project is no longer under active development. I have not been working
on the code for more than three years. Please consider
[Iodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/iodide) as an alternative, which
is actively maintained and of far better quality than arithmepad ever was.
I am leaving the code available for public inspection hoping that someone
might find it useful.

## arithmepad
arithmepad is a JavaScript based web notebook than runs entirely in the
browser. There is no server side component. Look and feel as well as
behaviour has been heavily inspired and shamelessly copied from
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
